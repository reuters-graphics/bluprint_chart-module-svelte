# Developing chart modules

### Using the dev server

Start the development server to begin working on your chart module.

  ```
  $ runner start
  ```

When you're finished, build out your chart module as a library.

  ```
  $ runner build
  ```

The build process will bundle your chart module for others to install from GitHub. It will also create a GitHub docs page to preview your chart, which you can publish by updating the GitHub Pages settings on your repo in GitHub (use the `docs/` folder on the `master` branch).
